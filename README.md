# MAGMA_analysis_protocol
This repository hosts the data and code used to present a quick-start protocol to perform generalised gene-set analysis of GWAS data on a metaset of gene lists generated by upstream pipelines, such as differential expression analysis, using the MAGMA software package and Hi-C coupled H-MAGMA annotation data (de Leeuw et al., 2015; Sey et al., 2020). We specifically tailored the steps and operations to meet the multithreading capability in modern computers, a feature nowadays shared by personal computers and high-performance clusters alike. 

For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to:
